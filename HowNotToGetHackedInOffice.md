# How not to get hacked in office?
1. Don't leave your laptop open, there was a reason the logout button was invented.
2. Don't connect your webcam or leave your laptop's webcam open, unless you have an important meeting over skype.
3. Disable or seal all your USB ports specially the ones which are right in front of your machine.
4. Always check if there are some unknown devices connected to your machine before you bootup.
5. Avoid using wireless keyboards and mouse.
6. Don't plugging in pendrives or other external devices to your computer if you don't know that person.
7. Always make sure the case of your CPU is always cover, naked machines(CPUs) are not sexy if they are in your office.
8. Your access card or password token is not something to show off, make sure you don't keep them exposed outside office premises.
9. Remove your RAM and disk from your machine and take them with you or put them in storage if you are going on a long holiday.
10. Configure a strong password for your computer and BIOS which has nothing to do with your personal life, something easy to remember but impossible to guess. Set multipe password each different from the other if you have access to servers.
11. Don't be stupid, Don't write your username and password on a sticky note and paste them anywhere near your disk.
12. When it comes to workplace the less people know the better, don't tell anyone where you sit if not needed.
13. Avoid taking selfies in office and posting them on social media and specially in such a way where the hardware you use is visible. 
14. Don't use password managers, use your brain to store passwords.
15. Make sure that no document which is valuable to your career or your company is left on your desk exposed for anyone and everyone to read when you leave.
