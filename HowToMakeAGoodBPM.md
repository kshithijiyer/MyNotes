### How to make a near to perfect BPM?
1. Before you start with the BPM make sure you know the business properly. If no ask questions and find out answers on your own or from the client/BA.
2. Now note down all the various entities in your client's company. Make sure you have all the entities are clearly listed. Remember that no department is small enough to be excluded.
3. Map the key business processes with the different entities you have listed. 
4. Draw the BPM on paper or use a tool.
5. Check if all the entities and all the processes critical to the business are properly represented or not.

### Final Touch Up
6. Make sure all the business entities are aligned properly and have the same size. 
7. Make sure all the business entities are of the same size as the largest business entity(in terms of size).
8. All the connections should be visible clearly in the diagram(no crisscross designs in the BPM). 
9. Label the diagram properly.
10. Done
